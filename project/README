PROJECT CONFIGURATION
------------------------
You must do the following before you launch the project on Kathara:

1. Replace 11 in the ASN file to your own AS number, e.g., 100 if your are AS100.
2. Edit device and link configuration of your AS at the end of the lab.conf file.
3. Change BGP peering of AS1 and AS21 from AS11 to your ASN in the files below:
   - as1r1/etc/quagga/bgpd.conf 
   - as21r1/etc/quagga/bgpd.conf
4. Add configuration folders and startup scripts for your devices
   - For example, r1 should be: asXr1 and asXr1.startup where X is your ASN
   - Similarly, asXs1, asXc1 for s1 and c1, respectively.
   - You must add folder and startup script for all device including clients
     even though there is no extra config (you simply have an empty folder)

START KATHARA
------------------------
Kathara launches one terminal per device when it starts.
With our project configuration, you will see many terminals, which can be overwhelming.
To avoid this, you may start kathara without any terminal and connect to each device manually. 
In this way, you don't have to deal with terminals belonging to other ASes.
To start kathara without terminal, run:
  kathara lstart --noterminals

DHCP CLIENT CAVEAT
------------------------
DHCP client cannot update /etc/resolv.conf.
Nevertheless, it should create a tentative file with a similar name below:
  /etc/resolv.conf.dhclient-new.XX
where XX is number that changes over time
You will have to copy it manually with a command:
  cp /etc/resolv.conf.dhclient-new.XX /etc/resolv.conf
You need to do this, otherwise DNS will not work correctly.

INTERNET SERVICE STARTUP SCRIPTS
------------------------
When you add Internet services to the startup configuration,
you must use the commands based on the startup scripts in /etc/init.d.
For example, you can run DNS service with the command:
  /etc/init.d/bind start
You may get penalty if you use other methods to run the services.
For DHCP client, you must use the /sbin/dhclient command, as shown below:
  /sbin/dhclient <INTERFACE>

HOST IP ADDRESS IN STARTUP SCRIPTS
------------------------
You must use the ip command to configure IP address and default route
in the startup script.
ifconfig and route commands are deprecated and considered as wrong.
You may also be penalized if you use them.
